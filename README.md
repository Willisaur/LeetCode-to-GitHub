## About
This Chrome extension uses fetch requests and the Chrome extension API to automate uploading LeetCode solutions to your GitHub account.

### Auth token
A GitHub authentication token is required. This can be done by going to profile > settings > developer settings > personal access tokens > fine-grained tokens OR tokens (classic). It is recommended to ensure the token can be used to delete and create repos, see repo information, see commit/file information, and create/commit to files. This token is only stored in your Chrome account storage.

### Commit file structure
All LeetCode problems are separated by folders, and solutions are in each folder and separated by languages. To view submission statistics, look at the extended commit description.
