## About
This Chrome extension uses fetch requests and the Chrome extensions API to automatically upload accepted LeetCode solutions to your GitHub account.

## Using the extension
This extension is pretty new and could still use some refining. However, all major functionality has been tested and works. Please let me know if you find any bugs, but know that it may take a while to fix. Moreover, I am a college sophomore, and I used ChatGPT to help me build this extension and learn more about JavaScript. Some of the code is poorly written, and I know that. Please know that I will be working on this and learning more web programming in the future. I would appreciate any tips or help I can get.

### Auth token
A GitHub authentication token is required. This can be done by going to profile > settings > developer settings > personal access tokens > fine-grained tokens OR tokens (classic). It is recommended to ensure the token can be used to delete and create repos, see repo information, see commit/file information, and create/commit to files.

### File structure
All LeetCode problems are separated by folders, and solutions are in each folder and separated by languages. To view submission statistics, look at the extended commit description.

## Thank you
